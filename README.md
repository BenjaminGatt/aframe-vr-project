# Aframe VR Project

## Description
Three different 3D VR scenes created with a JavaScript framework called Aframe. This project was made for a unit in the first year of my degree course.

## How to run
To run this project, clone the repository or download and extract the folder, and open index.html using a local server. This is necessary because otherwise textures will not be loaded.
